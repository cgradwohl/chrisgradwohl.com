					Hey I'm Chris. I am originally from the Bay Area but now call the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Northern California my home. I enjoy spending time with my children and wife, usually exploring mountain trails and nearby lakes. I am a pretty good home cook and often look for an excuse to open a bottle of wine and feed people. I love boxing, weightlifting, and being in the mountains. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I write software mostly because I enjoy problem-solving, but also because I like building products that people enjoy using. I am most experienced with full-stack TypeScript codebases, but I want to work more with Erland, Python and Go. I like system design, scalability, and working with cloud technologies. I was recently reconized by AWS as an AWS Community Builder thanks to my tutorials and blog at <a href="https://www.cloudspark.dev/">Cloudspark</a>.
